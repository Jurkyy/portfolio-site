				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I am an ambitious and driven individual with a strong
						passion for computer science and software engineering.
						With a proven track record of success, I am constantly
						seeking new challenges to push myself beyond my comfort
						zone.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my time at Technical University of Delft, where I
						pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I
						specialized in data science and AI. I took a minor
						abroad in Stockholm, Sweden, where I gained a deeper
						understanding of Ethical Hacking and Multi-Agent
						Systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my Master's degree, I focused extensively on Deep
						Learning, Quantum Computing, and the field of Side
						Channel Analysis. I even published a <a
							href="https://github.com/AISyLab/side-channel-analysis-toolbox"
							>toolbox</a
						> in side channel analysis that is still being utilized by
						researchers today.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to my academic achievements, I have been
						actively engaged in personal projects, particularly in
						Rust development. These projects have allowed me to
						apply my knowledge and enhance my skills in a practical
						setting. I have also dedicated my time as the Chief
						Software Engineer at Forze Hydrogen Racing, where I led
						a team of talented individuals in building the world's
						fastest hydrogen race car. This experience provided me
						with valuable insights into C++ programming and honed my
						skills in planning, presenting, and collaborative
						teamwork.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, I have been working at Flowtraders in
						Amsterdam since August 2022, where I have contributed to
						the development of various projects and continued to
						expand my skill set.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of academia and work, I have made significant
						strides in the field of Powerlifting. As a coach, I have
						been able to share my expertise and guide others in
						their powerlifting journeys. I have also collaborated
						with a friend to develop a unique coaching website,
						which has gained recognition and is even utilized by one
						of the top powerlifting coaches.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am motivated by challenges and thrive in environments
						where innovation and growth are encouraged. I am eager
						to apply my skills and expertise to tackle complex
						problems and contribute to the success of organizations
						that align with my values and aspirations.
