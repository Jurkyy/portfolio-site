				<h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I am an ambitious and driven individual with a strong
						passion for computer science and software engineering.
						With a proven track record of success, I am constantly
						seeking new challenges to push myself beyond my comfort
						zone.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						During my time at <a href="https://tudelft.nl"
							>Technical University of Delft</a
						>, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer
						Science, I specialized in data science and AI. I took a
						minor abroad in Stockholm, Sweden, where I gained a
						deeper understanding of Ethical Hacking and Multi-Agent
						Systems.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In my Master's degree there, I delved extensively into
						Deep Learning, Quantum Computing, and the field of Side
						Channel Analysis. Notably, I had the privilege of
						publishing a <a
							href="https://github.com/AISyLab/side-channel-analysis-toolbox"
							>toolbox in Side Channel Analysis</a
						>, which has made a lasting impact and continues to be
						utilized by researchers in the field.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In addition to my academic achievements, I have been
						actively engaged in personal projects, particularly in
						Rust development. These projects have allowed me to
						apply my knowledge and enhance my skills in a practical
						setting. I have also dedicated my time as the Chief
						Software Engineer at <a
							href="https://forzehydrogenracing.com/"
							>Forze Hydrogen Racing</a
						>, where I led a team of talented individuals in
						building the world's fastest hydrogen race car. This
						experience provided me with valuable insights into C++
						programming and honed my skills in planning, presenting,
						and collaborative teamwork.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						After working at <a
							href="https://flowtraders.com">Flow Traders</a
						> in Amsterdam from August 2022 to December 2024, where I contributed
						to the development of various projects with a focus on DevOps and system engineering,
						I moved to London to join <a
							href="https://hudsonrivertrading.com">Hudson River Trading</a
						> as a TradOps Analyst. There, I support and optimize trading operations
						at one of the world's leading quantitative trading firms.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have
						actively contributed to the field of Powerlifting. As a
						competitive powerlifter and coach, I have had the privilege of sharing my knowledge
						and supporting others on their powerlifting journeys.
						I co-founded <a href="https://woto.app">WoTo</a>, a SaaS app
						for powerlifting coaches that now has over 100 monthly paying users.
						I also served as Head of the D.S.K.V. IJzersterk board from 2021 to 2022.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I am motivated by challenges and thrive in environments
						where innovation and growth are encouraged. In my spare time,
						I build trading systems with Rust. I am eager
						to apply my skills and expertise to tackle complex
						problems and contribute to the success of organizations
						that align with my values and aspirations.
