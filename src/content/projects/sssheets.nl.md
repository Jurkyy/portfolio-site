We have developed a dynamic website tailored for powerlifting coaching, aimed at overcoming the limitations of conventional tools like Google Sheets or Excel. Our website provides athletes and coaches with a range of features and analytics that significantly enhance their training experience. In this article, we will explore the key functionalities and advantages of our website, which offers a seamless mobile experience that traditional spreadsheet-based solutions lack.

#### Features

Our powerlifting coaching website offers an array of features designed to benefit both athletes and coaches. These features include:

1. Athlete Overview:
Athletes have access to a detailed overview of their training program, allowing them to review exercises, intensity, volume, and comments provided by their coach. The platform also provides predictive results for future training sessions, enabling athletes to plan their progress effectively.

2. Coach Overview:
Coaches benefit from a flexible training planning interface, enabling them to create training weeks using a special templating method. This feature facilitates efficient program creation while maintaining granular control over training variables. The coach overview empowers coaches to curate individualized training plans for their athletes.

3. Data Analytics:
Both coaches and athletes can access the data analytics page, providing valuable insights into the athlete's development. The analytics cover various aspects, ranging from a simple bodyweight tracker to deeper insights into the relationship between strength work and hypertrophy. These analytics aid in monitoring progress and making informed training adjustments.

4. Admin Control:
The website includes an admin page that allows administrators to manage coach-athlete relationships, ensuring data security and confidentiality. This feature prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information and provides a secure environment for users.

5. Leaderboard:
In addition to the aforementioned features, our website includes a dynamic leaderboard that showcases the strength achievements of lifters within their specific weight classes or overall rankings. This leaderboard fosters a strong sense of community among our Supreme Strength athletes, as they are familiar with one another. By highlighting the strongest performers, the leaderboard encourages friendly competition and camaraderie among the athletes.

#### Technological Choice: Svelte
We opted for Svelte as our web development framework for several reasons. Svelte excels in mobile support and offers robust client-side capabilities, enabling us to deliver an exceptional user experience. The framework provided our development team, Eric and Wolfgang, with extensive opportunities to enhance user interactions and streamline website performance. With more than 10,000 lines of code and months of collaborative effort, we have created an impressive project leveraging Svelte's strengths.

#### Repository & code
Currently, our repository is private, and we do not plan to make it public in the future. To explore the website, please contact us for a temporary access account. You can find the repository at if it ever becomes public: [here](https://github.com/Jurkyy/gym-bro-site)
