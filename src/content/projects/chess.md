This project represents my effort to enhance my Rust programming skills by taking on a more comprehensive challenge. I aimed to deepen my understanding of software design principles, leverage Cargo – Rust's package manager, and refine problem-solving techniques.

#### Implementation

At its core, the project is a complete chess game implementation. Players can engage with the chessboard using standard algebraic notation, adding familiarity to the user experience. The implementation includes support for Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) strings, facilitating integration with advanced features like chess engines and AI bots.

#### Code design

Beyond chess, the project exemplifies clean and decoupled code design for maintainability. By focusing on performance optimization and best practices, I aimed to create an efficient implementation.

This journey has honed my Rust skills, explored software development nuances, and embraced the Rust ecosystem. Explore the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jurkyy/chess).

The journey continues, with anticipation for future developments as I refine my Rust proficiency.
