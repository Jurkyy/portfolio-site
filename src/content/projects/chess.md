This project represents my personal endeavor to enhance my programming skills in Rust by tackling a more extensive scope. Its primary goal was to deepen my understanding of project design and improve my utilization of Cargo, the Rust package manager.

Although the chess game implementation is complete, the user interaction aspect remains relatively basic at this stage. Currently, players can only move pieces using standard chess notation. Notably, this implementation boasts comprehensive support for FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings, a feature that will prove invaluable when developing a chess bot that can leverage this implementation.

Through this project, I aimed to advance my proficiency in Rust programming, broaden my knowledge of project architecture, and optimize my utilization of Cargo's capabilities.

As always, the respository can be found [here](https://github.com/Jurkyy/chess).
