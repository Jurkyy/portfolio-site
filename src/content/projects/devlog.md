Devlog is a tool designed to bridge the gap between coding and content creation. It automatically captures and transforms coding sessions into video-ready documentation, streamlining the process of creating development tutorials and project documentation.

#### The Problem

Creating development content often requires significant post-processing work. Developers must manually document their coding sessions, capture screenshots, and organize their thought process into coherent narratives. Devlog aims to automate much of this workflow.

#### Key Features

The tool provides several capabilities to enhance the documentation workflow:

* Automatic capture of coding session activity
* Intelligent formatting for video and written content
* Session organization and metadata management
* Export options for various content formats

#### Technical Implementation

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, Devlog leverages:

* Efficient event capture and processing
* Clean CLI interface for developer-friendly usage
* Modular architecture for extensibility
* Cross-platform compatibility considerations

#### Use Cases

Devlog is particularly useful for:

* Tutorial creators documenting coding walkthroughs
* Developers maintaining project documentation
* Teams creating onboarding materials
* Content creators producing development-focused videos

This project reflects my interest in developer tooling and improving the content creation workflow.
