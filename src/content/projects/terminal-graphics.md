These projects explore the fascinating intersection of mathematics and terminal rendering. Using Rust's performance and ANSI escape codes, I've created mesmerizing visual effects that run entirely in the command line.

Both projects demonstrate how linear algebra concepts like rotation matrices and distance fields can be applied to create smooth, animated graphics without any graphical libraries - just characters printed very fast to the terminal.
