This repository contains the complete configuration for my personal homeserver setup. It represents my approach to self-hosting services while maintaining reproducibility and documentation through infrastructure-as-code practices.

#### Infrastructure as Code

The entire server configuration is managed through shell scripts and configuration files, making it easy to:

* Reproduce the setup on new hardware
* Track changes over time with version control
* Share and document the configuration publicly

#### Self-Hosting Philosophy

Running a homeserver allows for greater control over personal data and services. This project includes configurations for various self-hosted applications and services, demonstrating practical DevOps skills in a home environment.

#### Technical Components

The configuration covers multiple aspects of server administration:

* Service orchestration and management
* Network configuration and security
* Backup and recovery procedures
* Monitoring and maintenance automation

#### Learning and Experimentation

The homeserver serves as a platform for learning and experimenting with:

* Container orchestration
* Reverse proxy configurations
* SSL/TLS certificate management
* System hardening and security practices

This project reflects my interest in infrastructure management and the self-hosting movement.

You can find the configuration on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jurkyy/homeserver).
