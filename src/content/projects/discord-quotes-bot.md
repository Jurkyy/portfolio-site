This is a discord quotes bot that can post, analyse and search for specific posts made in a discord guild. 
The current `master` branch is made for a Discord of a friend of mine. You can find the codebase for it [here](https://github.com/Jurkyy/discord-quote-bot).

#### Features:
- `!quote` command that posts a random quote from a channel called `quotes`.
- `?` operator makes all responses by the bot posted in your private messages with the bot.
- Field `$1` of the bot can currently be used to search for specific quotes.
- Some hidden commands...

#### Upcoming features (on hold):
- Make quote class and standardize output message with this class
- Make "Guess the author of the quote"-game
- Handle @person (maybe handled with quote class already?)
- Text to speech option for quotes
