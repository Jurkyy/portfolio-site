This project focuses on the implementation of quantum entanglement purification protocols, specifically the DEJMPS and 3 → 1 distillation protocols. The aim was to explore, visualize and analyze the differences between these purification methods and understand their respective advantages and disadvantages.

While there was an additional objective for the project to implement and compare the BBPSSW and EPL protocols too, concerning success rate and fidelity, due to time constraints, the implementation details were not included in the associated paper. The research conducted, however, highlights that the 3 → 1 protocol demonstrated a lower success rate and slightly higher fidelity compared to the DEJMPS, considering the same values of channel and gate fidelity.

#### Paper

For more detailed information on the research and comparison of the DEJMPS and 3 → 1 protocols, please refer to the research paper: [PDF](/assets/entanglement-purification.pdf). This is as a mere blog post is too small to give all the details regarding such a complex topic like quantum entanglement purification.

The implementation and simulation code for this project can be found on GitHub: [Repository](https://github.com/Jurkyy/entanglement-purification).
