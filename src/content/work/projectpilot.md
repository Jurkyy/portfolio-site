Introducing an automated project scaffolding tool that streamlines the initial setup process, including Docker configuration, based on ChatGPT queries. This tool is perfect for swiftly establishing a project foundation and diving right into development.

Drawing inspiration from the [code-muse-project](https://github.com/security-union/code-muse-rs/), this endeavor builds upon the original concept, introducing various enhancements and additional features. These improvements include, but are not limited to:

* Specification and validation of the OPEN_API_KEY
* Enhanced error handling mechanisms for greater reliability
* Strict adherence to the Rust language's coding style guidelines
* Elimination of jokes (acknowledging they weren't particularly humorous)
* Option to specify the project path
* By incorporating these advancements, the aim is to provide an even more polished and efficient experience for project initialization.
