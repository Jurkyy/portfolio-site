One of my early projects in Rust that truly captivated me and deepened my love for the language was my personal reimplementation of the "cat" tool. In Unix-based terminals, "cat" is widely used to display the contents of a file. I recreated this tool in Rust, incorporating additional options and the ability to concatenate multiple files in a single command execution. You can explore the repository [here](https://github.com/Jurkyy/rcat).

Another exciting project I embarked on while learning Rust was creating my very own shell, a command-line interface (CLI) program. We've all marveled at the mysterious black box that hackers use to perform their impressive computer feats, and that inspired me to develop my own shell. Each line in the shell is adorned with a delightful :fire: emoji because, well, it's just that cool. Within the shell, I implemented a custom version of the "cd" command, allowing users to navigate directories and explore the filesystem. For other commands, the shell can pass them through to the underlying system, be it Windows or a Unix-based platform, and execute them accordingly.
